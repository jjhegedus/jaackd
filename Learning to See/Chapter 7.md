Chapter 7: What Counts as Practice

Marek had been back for weeks before Paul realized he was really back.

At first, he was just there early, hitting balls on the far table before anyone else showed up. No crowd. No games. Just racks and resets, the sound of balls breaking and gathering again. Paul noticed the repetition before he noticed the limp.

Marek didn’t say much when Paul arrived. He didn’t stop practicing either. He worked through straight pool racks slowly, methodically, the way someone does when they’re testing something they don’t trust anymore.

Paul finished a game and wandered over.

“You’re early,” Paul said.

Marek nodded. “I need the time.”

Paul watched him shoot for a while. The stroke still looked right. Compact. Quiet. But something wasn’t finishing. Balls didn’t open the way they used to. Break shots nudged clusters instead of breaking them.

Marek reset the rack without comment.

Later that afternoon, after Paul had played and won another set, Marek said, “You’re always playing.”

Paul shrugged. “That’s how you get better.”

Marek shook his head. “That’s how you stay entertained.”

Paul smiled. “I’m winning.”

“I know,” Marek said. “Every time I see you, you’re playing someone. Usually winning.”

He didn’t say it like praise.

“How is that helping?” Marek went on. “You miss a ball, you blame the game. You make one, you forget how. That’s not practice.”

He walked over to Paul’s table and set a long, straight-in shot.

“You can’t draw the ball,” Marek said.

Paul laughed. “Come on.”

“Show me,” Marek said.

Paul hit the ball low. The cue ball came back a few feet and stopped.

Paul straightened. “See?”

Marek didn’t react. “How far were you trying to draw it?”

Paul hesitated. “Back.”

Marek spun the chalk on the cloth, leaving a blue circle.

“To here,” he said.

Paul shot again. Too short.

“Again.”

Too long.

Paul frowned. “That was close.”

Marek shook his head. “Random.”

Paul got it inside the circle once and looked up.

Marek wiped the circle away and spun it again.

“Inside,” he said. “Every time. Come back when you can do that.”

Then he went back to his own table.

That was how Marek worked.

He practiced. Paul practiced. Sometimes together. Often apart. Marek added things when he saw gaps.

“Stay down,” he said, when Paul popped up early.

“If your head comes up before the cue stops, you don’t own it.”

Another day, Marek racked fourteen balls.

“Straight pool,” he said.

Paul frowned. “I’m playing rotation.”

“You’re practicing now,” Marek said. “Straight pool teaches patterns. Rotation forgives bad decisions.”

They worked racks slowly. Marek stopped Paul often.

“Why’d you move that ball?”

“It was in the way.”

“It wasn’t bothering anyone yet.”

Reset.

Marek showed him break shots, how to arrive at them instead of forcing them. How to leave balls for later. How not to solve every problem immediately.

“Same problems come back,” Marek said. “Learn them.”

Paul noticed Marek working on the same things himself.

Especially the break shots.

One afternoon, Paul stopped mid-rack.

“This is fine,” he said.

Marek shook his head. “It gets ugly later.”

Paul frowned. “Where?”

“Right there,” Marek said, pointing farther down the table. “You’re letting it sit.”

“I can deal with it.”

“Not when it matters,” Marek said. “Fix it now.”

He bent down to show him.

For just a second, as Marek dropped into the stance, his shoulder twitched.

The cue dipped. The hit was off. The ball glanced into the cluster instead of opening it. Nothing broke. Everything locked up worse.

Marek straightened fast.

“Goddammit,” he snapped, slamming the cue on the rail.

The sound hung there.

Paul didn’t say anything.

He calmly reset the balls.

“Oh,” Paul said, like something had just clicked. “I get it.”

Marek looked at him.

Paul played the early shot, soft and deliberate, nudging the problem ball open just enough. Nothing else moved.

He stayed standing and traced the rest of the rack. One ball. Two. Three. Clear.

Marek watched, jaw tight.

“Yeah,” he said. “You got it.”

He picked up his cue and turned away.

“Now practice it,” he said over his shoulder. “A lot.”

Paul did.

So did Marek.

But Paul’s break shots started opening.

Marek’s didn’t.

One evening, alone on the far table, Marek lined up another breakout. Same angle. Same speed he’d trusted his whole life.

The ball didn’t open.

He stood there longer than usual, cue resting on the rail.

He didn’t rack again.

The next day, he didn’t practice.

After that, he didn’t line up break shots anymore.

He still watched Paul. Still corrected him. Still said “stay down” and “earlier” and “don’t buy trouble.”

But he didn’t bend down to show shots like he used to.

Without saying anything, Marek crossed a line of his own.

By the time the ACUI qualifier went up on the wall, Paul knew Marek wasn’t trying to get his game back anymore.

And Marek knew Paul didn’t need him to.
