Prologue — The Game I Didn’t Get to Play (Final)

When I arrived at the university, I thought I knew how to play pool.

I had grown up on a bar box. I could make balls. I understood angles. I’d won enough cheap games to believe the rest was just refinement. Bigger tables, longer shots—nothing that felt fundamental.

The university room changed that.

It was the first place I’d spent real time on full-size tables. Not just walking past them, but living there. They exposed distance, speed, and mistakes I didn’t yet have names for. Still, I thought the adjustment was mechanical. Practice. Repetition. Time.

Then I played Cole.

Cole didn’t look like the best player in the room. He stood too high, used too much wrist, talked constantly. He never seemed focused. He never seemed serious. If I’d been asked to describe him before we played, I would have said confident, maybe reckless.

We played rotation.

A dollar a point.

One hundred twenty-five points in the rack.

It was one game.

Cole never tried to run out.

When the shot was obvious, he took it. When it wasn’t, he moved the cue ball somewhere that felt temporary, harmless. I kept waiting for my turn—for the table to open, for a mistake, for the game to turn.

It didn’t.

I never made a ball.

Not one.

The rack didn’t end so much as disappear. A point here. Two there. Nothing dramatic. Nothing that felt like a loss until suddenly there were no points left.

One hundred twenty-five dollars.

I didn’t have it.

I gave him everything in my wallet. It wasn’t close to enough, but it was all I had. There would be no more pool for a while.

Cole told me to pay him later. Then he moved on, already playing someone else.

What stayed with me wasn’t the money.

It was the realization that I had been standing at a table, cue in my hand, believing I was playing pool—

and I wasn’t even close.
