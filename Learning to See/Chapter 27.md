Chapter 27: Why Aiming Systems Fail

Paul had learned them all.

Ghost ball.
Contact point.
Fractions.
Edges.
Halves of halves of halves.

Some of them worked. Often enough to feel reliable.

That was the problem.

Aiming systems promised certainty. If you lined things up correctly, the table would behave. The rest would take care of itself.

For a long time, Paul believed that.

Then he noticed something he couldn’t unsee.

Aiming systems worked best on shots that didn’t push the table very hard.

Firm shots.
Stun shots.
Less-thin cuts.
Familiar cloth.

They failed first on thin cuts. On soft shots. On shots with spin. On shots where pressure was present and the cue ball arrived fragile.

That wasn’t an accident.

Aiming systems assumed a world that didn’t exist.

They assumed the cue ball was a point.
They assumed friction was a detail.
They assumed contact behaved smoothly and continuously.
They assumed geometry dominated physics.

Most of all, they assumed there was only one way the collision could behave.

Paul now knew that wasn’t true.

On cut shots, the collision lived near a boundary. Small changes in speed, spin, or delivery could push it from one friction regime into another.

And the regimes were nothing alike.

When the contact slid under kinetic friction, the object ball deflected in a limited, predictable way. Errors were bounded. The table behaved.

But if static friction appeared unintentionally, everything changed.

Static friction was roughly an order of magnitude stronger than kinetic friction. Forces spiked. Gearing appeared where it wasn’t expected. Small delivery differences produced large angular errors.

This was skid.

Rolling cue balls were worse.

With a rolling cue ball, the contact point on the cue ball was descending. The object ball became wedged between the cue ball and the cloth. Normal force increased, and friction increased with it.

The collision became violently sensitive.

That was why rolling balls skidded more — not less.

Paul had been taught the opposite.

He’d been told rolling was natural. That stun was risky. That draw was dangerous.

None of that survived contact with reality.

Draw helped by lifting the contact point and reducing the wedging effect, but it wasn’t a guarantee. The collision could still drift into static friction.

Outside English complicated things — but not in the simple way people described.

On very thin cuts, outside English reduced relative tangential velocity at the contact. That made unintended static friction more likely. When it failed, it failed badly. Skid appeared suddenly. The miss felt inexplicable.

Extreme outside spin could sometimes counter cut-induced throw completely, but it curved the cue ball, forced a thinner effective cut, and lived at the edge of physical control. It was nearly impossible to repeat, especially under pressure.

But Paul also saw something else.

On less-thin cuts, outside English worked beautifully — for a very different reason.

In those cases, skilled players instinctively selected just enough outside spin to counter the natural tangential velocity between the balls. At contact, the spin and the cut matched so closely that the points of contact had near-zero relative tangential motion.

Static friction appeared — but this time it was intentional.

The balls geared cleanly. Throw collapsed instead of exploding. The collision became precise rather than sensitive.

This was not luck.

It was not calculation.

Almost every good player did it instinctively.

Outside English wasn’t wrong.

It was exact when it was matched.

It worked with the rails too. Running English produced stable, predictable relationships between inbound and outbound angles. Position routes opened up. Patterns simplified.

But that regime was narrow.

Miss the match — too much spin, too little, or corrupted impulse — and static friction reappeared in its dangerous form.

Inside English was different.

By increasing relative tangential velocity at the contact, inside English guaranteed sliding. Kinetic friction remained dominant. The throw was larger, but more importantly, it was predictable.

Inside English didn’t remove throw.

It avoided catastrophe.

That was why it worked so well on thin cuts — and why it collapsed instantly if impulse purity failed.

Aiming systems couldn’t represent any of this.

They assumed friction behaved politely.
They assumed the collision obeyed geometry.
They assumed the cue ball arrived ideal.

Those assumptions only held when impulse was large, the cut wasn’t extreme, or the collision happened to be forgiving — like stun shots or medium cuts with correctly matched outside English.

Paul finally understood why stun shots felt so accurate.

Not because they were simple.

Because they were tolerant.

With near-zero rotation at impact, the collision stayed away from regime boundaries. Small delivery errors didn’t explode. Geometry matched expectation.

That was why aiming systems seemed to work there.

The physics was being kind.

But kindness disappeared the moment the shot got thin, soft, or pressured.

Impulse shrank.
Regime sensitivity exploded.
Friction dominated.

Aiming harder didn’t help.

Being careful didn’t help.

Paul saw now why players who leaned on aiming systems often got worse as they improved. The better the game demanded them to be, the more brittle their models became.

They aimed perfectly and missed anyway.

The failure wasn’t mental.

It was structural.

Great players didn’t aim less.

They aimed differently.

They didn’t try to predict the collision. They shaped the state the cue ball arrived in so the collision unfolded in a survivable regime.

Angle wasn’t the input.

It was the result.

Aiming systems tried to make the table simpler than it was.

The table refused.

And for the first time, Paul understood why no aiming system could ever survive contact with real pressure.

Because pressure didn’t break geometry.

It exposed friction.
