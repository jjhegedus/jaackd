Chapter 2 — Marek (Final)

I don’t remember noticing Marek when he first came into the room.

Most people didn’t.

He was friendly. Easy to talk to. He played whoever was around and didn’t seem to care much about the outcome. He didn’t draw attention to himself. He didn’t protect his time. If you were watching casually, there was nothing there to notice.

When we played, it felt ordinary.

The stakes were small. The games were reasonable. I had been winning lately, and I felt like I was still improving. Nothing about Marek felt threatening. He wasn’t someone I thought about when I walked into the room.

He played solid pool.

He made the balls that were there. He missed some. He didn’t rush or stall. He didn’t do anything that looked intentional. If anything, he seemed happy just to be playing.

The first night didn’t go well, but it didn’t feel like a warning. I told myself I’d been careless. The second time felt similar. The third followed the same shape. Close racks. Familiar frustration. Nothing decisive.

Weeks passed.

We played once or twice a week. Different games. Similar results.

I kept getting better.

My patterns improved. My speed control felt more reliable. I was seeing options I hadn’t seen before. Around the room, that improvement started to show. I was winning small amounts from the worst players and the loosest gamblers. Not enough to matter, but enough to feel like progress.

Every week, it ended the same way.

Whatever I made in the room slowly found its way into Marek’s pocket.

Not all at once. Not dramatically. Just steadily, as if by gravity.

Each time I felt closer. Each time the games felt competitive. Each time I believed that one more adjustment—one cleaner decision—would finally turn it.

And each time, it didn’t.

What I didn’t understand was that Marek was moving too.

Every time my game sharpened, his did as well—just enough. He never pulled away. Never announced anything. He stayed exactly where he needed to be.

The stakes never rose.

That was part of why I kept playing.

No one in the room thought Marek was especially good. He won a little. Lost a little. He was friendly to everyone. There was no edge to him, no sense that he was protecting anything.

Except the best players noticed.

They didn’t say anything. They didn’t need to.

After one of those nights—another quiet loss that felt smaller than it was—I was packing up when Eli came over.

He didn’t sit down.

“You’re not going to beat him,” he said.

I smiled. “I’m getting close.”

Eli nodded. “That’s why you won’t.”

I waited for him to explain what I was missing. Shots. Patterns. Something concrete.

“He’s better than you,” Eli said. “By enough that he can stay ahead without showing it.”

I told him Marek wasn’t doing anything special.

“Exactly,” Eli said.

He let that word hang.

“He’s letting you improve,” Eli continued. “And then he improves just enough to stay where he wants to be.”

That didn’t make sense to me.

“If he wanted to win more,” I said, “he could.”

Eli shook his head. “If he did, you’d stop playing.”

That was the part I couldn’t accept.

“He’s not taking advantage of you,” Eli added. “He’s just better—and patient.”

Then he walked back to his table.

I stood there longer than I needed to.

I replayed the weeks again—not rack by rack, but night by night. How I never quite caught up. How the gap never closed. How every small gain I made seemed to vanish the moment it mattered.

I had been told the truth.

I just couldn’t see it.

Later, I learned there was only one person in the room who might have been able to beat Marek consistently.

That was Calder.

Calder did beat him once, later that year, in the ACUI tournament. Cleanly. Publicly.

No one was sure what it meant.

Some took it as proof Marek wasn’t very good. Others wondered if it proved the opposite—that the only time Marek played straight through was the one time it didn’t matter to him.

By then, it didn’t matter to me.

What mattered was that I finally understood how dangerous it is to know something is true—

and still be unable to see it.
