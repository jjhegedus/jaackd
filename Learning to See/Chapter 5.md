Chapter 5: The Table They Could Afford

Paul didn’t make a speech about it.

He came home with grades, not arguments. Straight A’s, printed and folded once, handed over without ceremony. His dad looked at the paper, nodded, and set it down like something that needed time to settle.

They didn’t talk much about high school anymore. That chapter had closed itself. The invitation to walk with his class came in the mail a week later — an official letter, careful in its wording, granting government and economics credit for the courses Paul had taken at the university.

His dad read that one twice.

“Well,” he said finally. “Guess you did something right.”

Paul shrugged. Not dismissive. Just unused to praise that arrived without conditions.

A few nights later, his dad asked, “You still playing pool?”

Paul said yes.

That was the whole conversation.

The basement was measured after dinner. Not dramatically — just a tape measure, a few steps, a quiet shake of the head. A full-size table wasn’t happening. Not without knocking down walls, and not with money the way it was.

His dad didn’t say no.

He just said, “Big table won’t fit. And I can’t afford one anyway.”

Paul nodded. He hadn’t expected anything else.

A week passed.

Then his dad mentioned, casually, that a guy from work was selling a bar table. Solid enough. Not fancy. Decent rails. Reasonable price. “Figured we could at least look,” he said, like the idea had occurred to him on its own.

They went on a Saturday morning.

The table had seen some use. The cloth wasn’t perfect. The pockets were tight in a way that suggested intention rather than wear. Paul ran his hand along the rail, not saying much.

His dad watched him for a moment.

“It’s not a big table,” he said.

“I know,” Paul replied.

That was enough.

They moved it in pieces. Down the steps. Around the corner. Into the basement where it fit the way compromises do — not gracefully, but decisively. When it was finally assembled, his dad stood back and looked at it like someone checking off a box on a list.

“You earned something,” he said. “This seemed reasonable.”

Paul thanked him. He meant it in more than one direction.

That summer, the table became part of the house.

Paul practiced in the evenings, then late, then whenever the rest of the place went quiet. The bar table changed the game in small, irritating ways. Shorter distances. Faster decisions. Less room for correction.

The question from the pool hall didn’t go away.

If anything, it got louder.

Paul tried looking at the cue ball. Tried the object ball. Tried switching mid-practice, then refusing to switch at all. Sometimes the whole table would snap into clarity for a few shots — not sharp, exactly, but coherent.

Then it would vanish again.

He learned to keep shooting anyway.
