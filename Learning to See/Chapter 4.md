Chapter 4: The Question That Followed Him Home

Paul walked because he needed to.

Not because it was efficient — it wasn’t — and not because he couldn’t find a ride. He walked because the distance gave his thoughts somewhere to spread out without tripping over each other.

Seven miles, each way.

The city thinned gradually, then all at once. Streetlights grew farther apart. Storefronts turned dark. By the time he reached the pool hall, it felt less like arriving somewhere than slipping sideways into it.

The place didn’t advertise itself. No lessons. No leagues. Just a low sign, half-lit, and windows that didn’t invite you to look in.

Inside, the air carried the residue of old smoke and cleaner that never quite erased it. The front of the room was still alive — bar tables, noise, shortcuts — but Paul kept walking.

The back room held the real tables.

Big tables. Proper distance. Cloth that showed you exactly what you’d done wrong.

Simonis.

He paid for time and racked without ceremony. Shot for a while. Missed one he shouldn’t have. Then another. Then stopped shooting altogether.

That was when the room went quiet in a way that had nothing to do with emptiness.

The room was quieter than it should have been.

Not empty—there were still two tables lit, a couple of guys near the bar arguing softly about a safety—but quieter in the way places get late, when sound stops bouncing and just settles where it lands.

Paul stood at the head of the table with the cue balanced loosely in his hand. He wasn’t shooting. He hadn’t been shooting for a while. He’d set up the same shot three times and backed off each one.

Object ball on the long rail. Not frozen, but close enough to matter. Cue ball a few feet out, nothing exotic. The kind of shot he’d made thousands of times. The kind of shot that shouldn’t have required thought.

“Object ball,” he muttered, leaning in.
Then straightened.
“No—cue ball.”

He rolled the cue between his fingers, annoyed at himself for caring.

Object ball focus had felt right last month. He’d switched after a coach told him it simplified everything. Let the cue take care of itself. It had worked—for a while. Then in the last tournament, under lights that were just a little harsher than these, the pocket had seemed to slide sideways at the last moment, as if it hadn’t quite decided where it wanted to be.

Cue ball focus had been the answer before that. Control the white, everything else follows. That advice came from a player who never seemed rattled, even with cash on the line. Paul had tried it tonight. The stroke felt deliberate. Mechanical. The shot… didn’t.

He bent down again, eyes locked on the object ball this time, willing himself to commit.

It didn’t feel wrong.

It just didn’t feel right either.

He stood back up and exhaled through his nose.

“Some say object ball. Some say cue ball,” he said to no one. “Some say it doesn’t matter.”

He chalked, though the tip didn’t need it.

“They all play great pool.”

The chair in the corner creaked.

Paul hadn’t noticed the man sitting there before. Or maybe he had and filed him away as part of the room—hat pulled low, arms folded, body angled slightly away from the tables. The kind of presence that doesn’t announce itself.

The man didn’t look up.

“If it mattered which ball you looked at,” he said, voice flat, almost idle, “how could all of them be right?”

The words didn’t sound loud. They didn’t sound important.

But they landed.

Paul’s mouth opened, already forming a reply—something about preference, about feel, about champions being different—

And then it stopped.

The thought didn’t finish. It didn’t even fade. It simply… failed to arrive.

For a moment—he couldn’t tell how long—there was only the table.

Not the shot. The table.

The rails. The spacing. The way the object ball sat in relation to everything else instead of as a single thing demanding attention. Sounds he hadn’t noticed a second earlier drifted in: the low hum of the light ballast, the faint click of balls two tables over, the whisper of cloth as someone brushed chalk dust away with the side of a hand.

Time stretched. Not dramatically. Just enough to feel different.

Paul became aware that he was holding his breath.

He let it out and swallowed, suddenly unsure what he’d been muttering about before. The irritation that had been buzzing under his skin a moment ago was gone, replaced by something quieter and more unsettling.

Curiosity.

He turned toward the chair.

“Wait—” he said. “What do you mean?”

The chair was empty.

Not pushed back. Not obviously abandoned. Just empty, as if no one had been there to begin with.

Paul stared at it longer than made sense.

He walked over, half expecting the man to be standing just out of view, maybe near the bar, maybe lining up a shot at the far table.

Nothing.

The hat was gone too.

Paul looked back at the table. The shot was still there, unchanged. He set his cue down and took a step back, then another, as if distance might help him see what he’d just lost track of.

The question echoed—not loudly, but persistently.

If it mattered which ball you looked at…

He smiled once, without humor.

“Great,” he said softly. “Now I don’t know what I’m supposed to look at at all.”

From somewhere behind him, a ball dropped cleanly into a pocket.

Paul didn’t turn around.

He stepped back to the head of the table, not to shoot, but to stand. To look.

Not at the cue ball.
Not at the object ball.

At the whole thing.

And for just a moment—only a moment—the shot felt obvious.

Then the feeling slipped away.

Paul frowned, reached for his cue again, and bent down, trying to get it back.

(Exit forward — new, restrained)

He left without finishing his time.

The walk back felt longer.

The city was quieter now, stretched thin under the early morning. His legs moved automatically while the question replayed, not as words but as pressure — like something slightly out of alignment that couldn’t be ignored once you knew it was there.

He didn’t decide anything on that walk.

But by the time he reached his place, he knew he wasn’t done.
