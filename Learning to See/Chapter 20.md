Chapter 20: Where the Eyes Go

Paul copied the entire book.

Every page. Every diagram. Coin after coin disappearing into a machine that didn’t care what language it was swallowing. He didn’t skim. He didn’t select. He didn’t know enough to decide what mattered.

He copied all of it.

The folder lived under his bed afterward, thick and inert. He didn’t open it often. When he did, it was never for long. The math overwhelmed him. The French might as well have been symbolic.

But the book changed something anyway.

It made the glass house visible again — not shattered, not repaired — just standing there, elegant and suspect.

Paul never mentioned the book.

He never would.

What surfaced instead were questions. Concrete ones. The kind you could ask without revealing where they came from.

The first surprised him by how ordinary it sounded.

It came one night after a set, sitting on the rail with Eli while someone else racked.

“Where do you look when you shoot?” Paul asked.

Eli shrugged. “Depends.”

“On what?”

“The shot,” Eli said. “Sometimes the object ball. Sometimes the cue ball. Sometimes the pocket.”

Paul nodded. “That’s what everyone says.”

Eli glanced at him. “You disagree?”

“I don’t know,” Paul said. “I just know that when I’m really on, it doesn’t feel like I’m looking at anything in particular.”

Eli waited.

“It feels like the table becomes its own world,” Paul said slowly. “Three-dimensional. Self-contained.”

Eli leaned back against the rail. “Go on.”

“When it’s right,” Paul said, “I’m not in the room. I’m not even really there. The table is huge. The balls feel massive — like mountains. And the pockets aren’t targets.”

He paused.

“They’re reference points. They’re just there. Holding everything together.”

Eli nodded. “Fiducials.”

Paul turned. “What?”

“Fixed reference markers,” Eli said. “Vision systems use them to keep space registered.”

Paul felt that land.

“When I’m on,” he said, “I’m not staring at the pockets. But I know where all six of them are. They’re anchoring the space.”

“That’s peripheral vision,” Eli said. “Your fovea handles the contact. Your periphery holds the map.”

Paul frowned. “But I’m aiming.”

“Of course you are,” Eli said. “Your fovea doesn’t turn off. It just stops running the show.”

Paul leaned forward.

“Foveal vision is precise,” Eli continued. “Edges. Contact points. Fine detail. But it’s narrow. Peripheral vision gives you spatial stability. It tells you where things are relative to everything else.”

“That’s when the table feels solid,” Paul said. “Even if I move.”

“Exactly,” Eli said. “Under pressure, the brain hands control to the fovea. You lock onto the ball. Everything else drops away.”

“That’s when the table gets small,” Paul said quietly.

“And the fiducials disappear,” Eli said. “You lose the reference frame.”

Paul stared at the layout.

“That’s when speed goes,” he said. “And angles. It’s like the table won’t sit still.”

Eli nodded. “You’re losing the map.”

“I don’t mean I stop moving,” Paul said. “Movement is part of it. I always move in. Side to side a little. Up and down as I drop. That’s how the picture settles.”

“That’s sampling,” Eli said. “And it’s not the problem.”

Paul glanced at him.

“It’s how you build the model,” Eli said. “You’re letting the system average itself. Depth. Spacing. Alignment.”

“That’s why it has to be rhythmic,” Paul said. “If I rush it, the picture never finishes forming.”

“Exactly,” Eli said. “The problem isn’t sampling. It’s continuing to sample after you’ve committed.”

Paul felt that click.

“When I’m right,” he said slowly, “there’s a moment where the picture locks.”

“And when you miss under pressure,” Eli said, “you don’t trust that lock.”

“So I keep checking,” Paul said. “Tiny corrections. Trying to make it feel safe again.”

“And every new sample,” Eli said, “is taken from a slightly different state, a slightly different angle.”

Paul nodded. “So the world starts to drift.”

“Not because movement is bad,” Eli said. “But because the reference frame never stabilizes.”

Paul watched the next player step into a shot.

He noticed the small, rhythmic movements — the sway, the drop — and then the stillness that followed. The cue went through clean.

Paul wasn’t watching the ball.

He was aware of the pockets. All of them. The rails. The distances. The negative space between things. The way the table held together as a single object.

The shot fell.

Paul didn’t feel excited.

He felt unsettled.

Because nothing they had said sounded like a technique.

It sounded like a description of a state — one that couldn’t be forced and couldn’t survive once doubt reopened the evaluation loop.

“I don’t know how to train that,” Paul said.

“You don’t,” Eli said. “Not directly. You train everything around it so it doesn’t collapse.”

They sat in silence as the game continued.

The glass house was there again — larger now, enclosing not just patterns and speed, but perception itself. Transparent. Precise.

Paul could see the walls clearly now.

He just didn’t know how to live without them yet.
