Chapter 1 — The Room

Every pool room has an order.
I didn’t know that yet.

The university room looked open, almost democratic. Rows of full-size tables. Good light. No music loud enough to distract you. People drifting in and out between classes, between nights, between lives. It felt public, neutral—like skill would sort itself out naturally.

It doesn’t.

The order wasn’t written anywhere. No rankings. No brackets. You learned it by watching who waited, who didn’t, who paid, who collected, and who never seemed to play unless there was something at stake.

What surprised me early on wasn’t who would play—but who wouldn’t.

Some players didn’t play strangers at all. Not for money. Not for practice. Not even for cheap games. They played only with people they already knew, often the same small group, night after night. It wasn’t about protecting anything. They simply weren’t open to the room.

You could stand between those tables for years and never be part of that world.

None of that mattered, though.

I needed to get better on these tables if I was ever going to get my money back.
I needed practice.

So I stayed.

Weeks turned into months. I learned the distances. The speed. How unforgiving the tables were when you were careless. I worked on making balls cleanly and consistently. Long shots stopped feeling long. Patterns began to appear where before there had only been clutter.

I started to win.

Not against the best players. Not even close. But against the ones who played too fast, gambled too loose, or didn’t know when to stop. The worst gamblers. The worst players who still wanted to play for money.

I took their money carefully.

I learned who chased losses and who didn’t. Who talked themselves into bad games. Who believed confidence was the same thing as control. I wasn’t dangerous, but I wasn’t invisible anymore either.

The room started to make sense.

Some players stood out immediately.

Calder was one of them.

He wore jeans and cowboy boots, even indoors. Stood high on the ball, almost leaning back, feet close together like he wasn’t planning to move. He didn’t rush. Didn’t explain. Didn’t seem to care who was watching. When he played, the table felt smaller, like it belonged to him.

He didn’t gamble much. And when he did, it was never sloppy.

Others were harder to read.

Eli was always around.

He played well—very well—and he almost always played with Iris. Not exclusively, but close to it. They practiced together, ran racks together, and seemed content to keep things that way. Whatever their connection was, it wasn’t romantic. It was simply proximity.

On the table, they looked evenly matched.

Clean shots. Careful position. Long runs that made people stop and watch. Eli liked to talk—about angles, systems, why a ball went where it did. Iris talked less. She played.

I didn’t see much of Eli outside of that. He would play for fun if someone asked, but he avoided playing for money, even against people he should clearly beat. Including me. It didn’t feel evasive so much as disinterested, like gambling simply wasn’t part of how he measured himself.

Iris felt different.

She played with the same precision, but there was something steadier about her. Less commentary. Less drift. She finished racks the way she started them. I couldn’t yet tell what separated her from Eli, only that it existed.

She also stood out in the room in a way that had nothing to do with pool. There weren’t many women there, and none like her—no obvious boyfriend, no group orbiting her, no performance. She belonged there on her own terms.

I noticed her.

I didn’t yet understand what made her different.

At this point, I thought I understood the room.

I was making balls. I was winning some money. I could see who was good and who wasn’t. I knew who to play and who to avoid. I had recovered from Cole, and more importantly, I believed I had learned from it.

I thought the game was starting to open up.
