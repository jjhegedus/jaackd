Chapter 23: The Straight Stroke

Paul had heard it his whole life.

Straight stroke.
Straight back.
Straight through.

It was treated as fundamental — not a preference, not a model, but a requirement. If something went wrong, the explanation was already waiting: the stroke wasn’t straight enough.

People talked about Efren Reyes the same way.

“Incredible talent,” they’d say.
“Amazing feel.”
“And imagine how good he’d be with a straight stroke.”

As if the only reason Efren worked was because he’d somehow compensated for a flaw.

Paul didn’t believe that anymore.

Efren’s stroke wasn’t straight.

Not by any definition instructors used. The cue didn’t travel along a ruler’s line. The elbow moved. The wrist articulated. The follow-through wandered through space in a way that would get most players corrected within minutes.

And yet nothing about it looked fragile.

The stroke resolved the same way every time.

Paul realized then that “straight” wasn’t wrong.

It was incomplete.

Straightness was a two-dimensional abstraction applied to a three-dimensional, time-varying system. It described a snapshot of motion at contact and pretended that snapshot explained the whole event.

It didn’t.

From a physics standpoint, the idea collapsed immediately.

The arm wasn’t a rigid slider. It was a linked, compliant system — shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, grip — each segment moving on its own arc, each with its own inertia and timing. Trying to force that system into a perfectly linear path didn’t remove variability.

It moved it somewhere else.

Tension appeared where motion had been constrained. Compensations followed. Small errors amplified. The stroke became sensitive in exactly the places pressure made unreliable.

That was the irony.

The pursuit of straightness often made the stroke less stable.

Paul also began to understand why coaches loved it.

Straight-stroke instruction worked — especially at the beginning.

It reduced degrees of freedom. It gave beginners something visible and feelable. It made mistakes obvious and correction straightforward. It allowed coaches to diagnose problems without needing to understand the entire system.

For teaching, it was powerful.

It turned a complex, coupled motion into something discussable.

But that didn’t make it accurate.

It made it useful.

Straightness wasn’t truth. It was scaffolding.

And scaffolding only helps if you know when to remove it.

Paul had seen what happened when it stayed too long.

Players guarded their strokes. They monitored them. They checked alignment mid-shot. They protected straightness like it was something fragile.

Very careful.

And every act of supervision pulled them out of the state the stroke depended on.

The deeper problem was even simpler.

The best players weren’t making sure the cue tip arrived in the right place at the right time.

They were thinking past that.

What mattered wasn’t the path of the cue. What mattered was the cue ball’s arrival — where it would be, how fast it would be moving, and how it would be rotating when it got there.

The stroke wasn’t the objective.

It was the messenger.

Great players weren’t managing mechanics. They were shaping outcomes. They were sending the cue ball into the world with a destination, a velocity, and a spin that caused everything else to unfold the way it needed to.

That was why straightness missed the point.

Straightness described the tool.

The game cared about the result.

Once Paul started thinking this way, things he’d never reconciled before began to make sense.

Some of the best players he knew didn’t line up the way they were supposed to.

They lined up high and still drew the ball.
They lined up inside and still got clean outside spin.

He knew one good player who didn’t even address the cue ball from directly behind center. He stood slightly off to the side — visibly so — and still delivered exactly the speed and English the shot required.

It looked wrong.

It wasn’t.

Because what those players were aligning wasn’t the cue.

It was the result.

They weren’t aiming the tip at a point on the cue ball. They were sending the cue ball into a specific state — a trajectory, a rotation, a pace — that made the object ball go where it needed to go and the table open the way it was supposed to.

From that perspective, lining up “correctly” was optional.

The cue ball didn’t care where the cue started.

It cared how it arrived.

Efren’s stroke made sense now in a deeper way.

It wasn’t optimized to move the cue tip along a clean line. It was optimized to deliver the cue ball into a precise state — one that made the object ball behave, the next angle appear, the pattern continue.

The cue tip could wander.

The cue ball could not.

Paul tested this quietly.

He didn’t try to make his stroke straighter.
He didn’t try to make it looser either.

He paid attention to whether the stroke belonged to the same world as the picture he’d built — the same rhythm, the same breath, the same spatial field.

When it did, the stroke felt light. Inevitable. Like a release rather than an action.

When it didn’t, it felt heavy. Supervised. Separate.

He could feel the difference immediately.

One version demanded control.
The other did not.

That clarified everything.

The straight stroke wasn’t a hidden ideal he hadn’t achieved yet.

It was an oversimplification that had outlived its usefulness.

The best strokes weren’t straight.

They were self-consistent.

They preserved continuity from perception through motion to contact without collapsing under constraint.

Efren hadn’t overcome a flawed stroke.

He’d never accepted a flawed model.

Paul didn’t reject straightness outright.

He stopped treating it as meaningful.

It was no longer something to chase, check, or defend.

Just one shadow cast by a much larger system.

And once he let go of the idea that the cue needed to travel straight, the stroke stopped feeling like something he had to keep under control.

It felt like something that already knew where it was going.
