Chapter 15: The Book

Paul found the book because he belonged there.

The physics library felt different from the rest of campus — quieter, heavier, built for people who assumed they could take their time. He liked that. Physics was his degree. He was proud of it. It meant something to him that it was hard.

He was there for a problem set when the spine caught his eye.

Théorie mathématique du jeu de billard.

He smiled despite himself.

Of course.

He pulled it down and opened it where it fell.

French.

Not conversational French — formal, technical, the kind that assumed fluency and offered no mercy. The equations came immediately. No warm-up. No preface he could follow. Just symbols stacked into structures that didn’t simplify when he looked at them.

He recognized the math.

That was the problem.

Integrals he hadn’t taken yet. Differential equations he’d only seen hinted at. Limits nested inside expressions that assumed you already knew what you were doing.

He flipped a few pages, slower now.

There were diagrams — collisions, trajectories, angles — but they weren’t tables. They were abstractions. Idealized systems stripped of felt, chalk, humidity, and light. Nothing explained itself. Nothing paused to wait for him.

There were no explanations he could follow.

Paul closed the book and stood there longer than necessary.

He told himself it wasn’t meant for him yet. That it was graduate-level. That it was theory. That it didn’t matter for actually playing pool.

All of that was true.

And all of it made it easier to put the book back without admitting that he didn’t understand any of it.

As he slid it onto the shelf, the phrase came back to him — uninvited, unhelpful.

A beautiful glass house.

He didn’t know why it fit.

Just that it did.

He stood there a moment longer, looking at the spine, then turned back to his problem set. The equations on the page in front of him behaved the way equations were supposed to. Step by step. Assumptions stated. Results earned.

This, at least, still made sense.

Paul left the library carrying nothing new.

But the image stayed with him — clean lines, perfect angles, everything visible, everything precise.

And no way to tell, just by looking, how much it could really hold.
