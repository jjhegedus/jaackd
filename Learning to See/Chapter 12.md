Chapter 12: Still There

Paul walked because he didn’t feel like driving.

Not to go anywhere. Just far enough that the room — the money, the counting, the way Chuck never seemed hurried — could loosen its grip.

The hall was open.

Same big tables. Same lights. A few players spread out, unremarkable. Paul paid for time and racked without warming up.

He played.

Nothing flashy. Nothing forced. He took his time, came into the shot the same way every time, stayed down. The racks moved along. He missed one ball, then ran the next rack clean.

After a while, he noticed the man in the chair.

Same corner. Hat low. Folded in on himself like part of the room.

Paul didn’t acknowledge him.

He played another rack. Then another. He handled a small problem early instead of letting it sit. Took a longer shot instead of forcing position. Let the table give him what it gave him.

The man spoke without looking up.

“You’ve built a beautiful glass house.”

Paul paused for half a second, then finished the shot he was on.

He didn’t answer.

The words didn’t sound like advice. Or criticism. Or anything he could do something with.

Paul racked again. Shot. Missed. Shot again. The rhythm came back, but the sentence stayed — not loud, not urgent — just there.

When he finally glanced toward the corner, the chair was empty.

Paul didn’t search.

He finished his time, returned the balls, and left.

The walk back felt ordinary. Streetlights. Empty sidewalks. The university buildings rising ahead of him the way they always did.

A beautiful glass house?

He shook his head once and kept walking.

What the hell does that even mean?

He didn’t try to answer it.

But the words followed him all the way home.
