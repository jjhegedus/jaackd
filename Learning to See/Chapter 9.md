Chapter 9: Seeing What Stays Put

Paul didn’t notice the club gathering at first.

He was mid-rack when Iris came through the door, clipboard under her arm, keys already in hand. She stopped short when she saw him at the table — not annoyed, exactly, just recalculating.

The billiard club met there on Thursdays. Same table. Same time. Iris ran it because no one else would. She waited for a natural pause that didn’t come.

Paul kept shooting.

Not fast. Not slow. Just continuous — the cue never quite leaving his hand long enough to signal a break. The rack wasn’t easy. Two clusters. A long rail shot that demanded respect. Paul didn’t hesitate.

People drifted closer.

Eli arrived late, leaned against the far rail, and stayed there. He watched the way Paul moved — not the stroke, but what happened between shots. Paul wasn’t scanning. He wasn’t checking angles twice. He looked once, stepped in, and let the shot go.

The table stayed quiet.

Paul cleared the rack and moved directly into the next without looking up.

Iris cleared her throat. “Hey—”

Paul shot anyway.

A few laughs behind her. Not mocking. Curious.

She waited this time.

Paul finished the run and straightened, finally aware of the room. He nodded once, apologetic but unembarrassed.

“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t realize.”

“It’s fine,” Iris said. “We were just about to start.”

She glanced at the table, then at Eli, who raised his eyebrows slightly — not impressed, exactly, but interested.

“What were you working on?” Iris asked.

Paul thought about it, then shook his head. “Nothing specific.”

Eli smiled at that.

They took the next table instead. Paul stayed where he was. He didn’t join the club game. He didn’t leave either. He just played — quieter now, but no less committed.

After a while, Eli wandered over.

“You’re not playing patterns,” he said.

Paul looked up. “I am. Just not individually.”

Eli nodded slowly, like that sentence fit something he’d been circling without landing on.

“You’re not locking onto shots,” Iris said from behind him. “You’re letting them show up.”

Paul hesitated. That was closer than he expected.

“I stopped trying to hold onto anything,” he said finally.

They were quiet for a moment.

Eli leaned on the rail. “That’s why you don’t flinch when the table changes.”

Paul thought of the walk. The chair. The voice that hadn’t cared whether he understood.

“I flinch,” he said. “Just not at the ball anymore.”

Iris smiled. “You should come play with us sometime. Not the club stuff. Just… us.”

Paul nodded. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

As he bent down for the next shot, he felt the table arrive the way it had in flashes before — not as targets, not as instructions, but as a single, stable arrangement that didn’t care who was watching.

He didn’t try to keep it.

He didn’t need to.
