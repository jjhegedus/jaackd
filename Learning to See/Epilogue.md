Epilogue

I failed my second semester of senior year.

That’s the factual version. The cleaner version is that I quit. Or drifted. Or simply stopped showing up in a way that mattered.

I did come back. Took a fifth year. Finished the degree.

That part is true too.

The degree mattered. It probably mattered more, by most measures, than anything I learned on a pool table. It opened doors. It made a life that looked like success from the outside and mostly felt like it from the inside.

Before I quit pool for good, though, I agonized over it.

Not casually. Not romantically. I believed — quite seriously — that I could have been the best. Not good. Not competitive. The best. I don’t know if that belief was accurate. I do know it was sincere.

There was a man — older, established, with real money — who offered to take me on the road. Gambling. Big tournaments. Real action. A different life entirely.

I thought about it for a long time.

In the end, I convinced myself there wasn’t enough money in it. That even if I succeeded, it wouldn’t justify betraying the trust my parents had placed in me by sending me to Purdue. That choosing pool would mean choosing myself at their expense.

So I didn’t.

I chose the degree.
I chose the corporate route.
I chose a life that made sense on paper.

By most definitions, it worked.

I was successful. I solved hard problems. I was paid well. I did work I could defend. I just never believed in the pure profit motive. Not really. That made me useful, but it also made me confusing to the people at the top. It limited how far I could go, and I accepted that.

It was fine. For a long time.

Then my father was diagnosed with a terminal disease. He died at seventy-nine.

After that, some calculations stopped working.

I don’t romanticize the road I didn’t take. I don’t imagine an easy life, or a clean one. I know what that path would have demanded. I knew it then.

Still, I wonder.

Not whether I would have won more.
Not whether I would have been famous.
But whether I chose the right kind of difficulty.

I learned things on a pool table that stayed with me. About systems that behave until they don’t. About how pressure removes tolerance. About how the stories we trust most fail first.

Those lessons helped me. They also made certain kinds of success less convincing once I saw what they required.

I don’t know how to separate what pool gave me from what it cost. Or what the degree gave me from what it closed off. I no longer try to.

I still have the photocopies from the physics book. I’ve never really understood them. I might someday. Or I might not.

Their value was never in the answers.

They were proof that the complexity was real.

I don’t play much anymore. When I do, it comes back quickly — not the mechanics, but the feeling of being inside the table. Of the room going quiet in that specific way it does when attention widens instead of narrows.

That feeling never taught me how to win.

It taught me how to see.

And seeing changed what winning meant.

I don’t regret that.

I also don’t pretend it was free.

It simply is.
