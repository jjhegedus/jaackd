Chapter 17: Blind

Paul went back to the hall without deciding to.

He hadn’t stopped playing since the tournament. He still showed up. Still paid. Still racked. The motions were intact. Only the reason for them had thinned out.

He wasn’t practicing.
He wasn’t competing.

He was going through the motions.

The tables felt dull now. Not tighter. Not faster. Just emptied of meaning. Shots came and went without consequence. Makes didn’t register. Misses didn’t sting. He stayed down because that was what careful players did.

He ran a rack and felt nothing.

Missed the next one and didn’t care.

At some point, he noticed the chair.

Same corner. Same angle. Hat low.

Paul didn’t react. He finished the shot he was on, chalked out of habit, and stood there longer than necessary.

The man spoke.

“I see you’ve finally realized you’re blind.”

Paul laughed once, short and empty.
“It shattered.”

“Yes,” the man said. “You were very careful.”

The words didn’t sound accusing. They sounded factual.

Paul looked back at the table. The balls sat exactly where they always had.

“I did everything right,” he said. “I practiced. I planned. I stayed down.”

“You can never be too careful,” the man said.

Paul nodded faintly. He’d heard that before. A hundred times. It was supposed to mean something solid. Something safe.

Paul swallowed.

“Careful with speed. Careful with patterns. Careful not to make mistakes.” His voice thinned. “Careful not to lose.”

The man didn’t argue.

Because when Paul looked back toward the chair, it was empty.

The room went on. Balls clicked. A rack broke somewhere down the line. Nothing marked the moment.

Paul stood there for a long time.

The words stayed with him — not as a lesson, not as a warning — just as something unfinished.

You can never be too careful.

He didn’t know yet why that sentence felt different now.

He only knew it wouldn’t leave him alone.

Paul picked up his cue and put it back down again.

For the first time since the tournament, he didn’t try to fix anything.

He left the hall without finishing his time.
