Chapter 9: After the Noise

They went to Garcia’s because it was still open.

By the time they got there, the dinner rush was long gone and the place had settled into its late-night version of itself — a few tables occupied, the smell of grease baked into the air, music low enough to ignore. Iris ordered without asking. Eli grabbed a booth near the back.

Paul slid in opposite him and didn’t touch the menu.

They ate first.

Not rushed. Not ceremonially. Just enough pizza to quiet the body so the conversation could wander without tripping over itself. A pitcher of cheap beer appeared and slowly disappeared. Friday night stretched the way it only does when no one is trying to get anywhere else.

At some point — Paul wasn’t sure when — pool crept back in.

“I can’t explain it,” Paul said, staring at the condensation ring his glass had left on the table. “I know what works. I just don’t know why it stops.”

Eli leaned back. “Start from the beginning.”

Paul thought for a moment.

“Object ball focus,” he said. “Works great. Until it doesn’t. Cue ball focus too. Same story. And when it fails, it’s not gradual. The pocket doesn’t get smaller — it just… moves.”

Eli nodded, not interrupting.

“And when there’s pressure,” Paul went on, “it gets worse. Like my vision collapses inward. The more I try to be precise, the less stable everything feels.”

Eli picked at the label on his bottle.

“What about peripheral?” he asked.

Paul looked up. “That’s the only thing that survives.”

Eli’s eyebrows rose. “Survives how?”

“When I’m not trying to aim,” Paul said slowly. “When I’m aware of the table instead of the ball. Not staring. Not checking. Just… letting it be there. That’s when the shot feels obvious.”

Eli was quiet for a long time.

“That actually makes sense,” he said finally.

Paul laughed. “You’re the first person who’s ever said that and meant it.”

Eli leaned forward now, elbows on the table.

“When you lock onto a single point,” he said, “you’re asking a foveal system to do a spatial job. Depth, geometry, stability — that’s peripheral territory. When you narrow under pressure, you’re throwing away the scaffolding that keeps everything from drifting.”

Paul felt his chest tighten.

“And when I try to use the peripheral feeling,” Paul said, “it disappears.”

“Because now you’re asking it to explain itself,” Eli said. “The moment you check, you collapse it again.”

The words landed harder than Paul expected.

Not because they were new — but because they weren’t.

The chair in the corner.
The question that hadn’t cared if he understood it.
If it mattered which ball you looked at…

Paul set his glass down carefully.

“That’s it,” he said.

Eli blinked. “What is?”

“I wasn’t being asked where to look,” Paul said. “I was being asked why the picture stayed together at all.”

Eli smiled slowly. “Yeah. That tracks.”

Paul shook his head, half-laughing now.

“I’ve been trying to protect the method,” he said. “That’s why it keeps breaking.”

“Protection introduces fear,” Eli said. “Fear narrows attention. Narrowing kills structure.”

Paul sat back, letting it settle.

“I met a guy once,” he said. “Barely spoke. Asked one question. I wasn’t even sure he was real.”

Eli shrugged. “Doesn’t matter. The question was.”

They sat there until the beer ran out and the staff started stacking chairs. When they finally stood up, the night felt thinner, like it had been used up properly.

On the walk back, Paul noticed something quietly different.

He wasn’t trying to remember what had been said.

He didn’t need to.
