Chapter 9: Counting Backward

Paul spent what he made.

A hundred a week from Subway. Another hundred, give or take, from small games in the room. Rent, food, books — whatever was left disappeared quietly. He never carried more than a couple hundred on him because there was never a reason to.

Chuck did.

They were still in the university pool room, not some back hall where money could sit out in the open. Everything stayed discreet. Bills changed hands off to the side, folded, quick. Nothing on the table. Neither of them needed that kind of attention.

Chuck named fifty a set.

Paul did the math immediately.

Four barrels.

It was higher than he usually played, but not reckless. Fifty didn’t feel like a statement yet. It felt like a test.

Paul won the first set.

Chuck paid with a single fifty, peeled cleanly from the roll. The roll itself didn’t seem to change. It stayed thick in Chuck’s hand, like it hadn’t noticed the loss.

They played again.

Paul won the second set too. Chuck paid again. One fifty. Same motion. Same indifference. Paul was up a hundred now, and the number settled him. A small buffer. A little air.

The clock over the door said they had time for maybe four more sets before closing.

Chuck leaned on his cue.

“Let’s double it.”

Paul froze, just long enough to feel it.

Nothing had changed on the table. No games lost. No momentum shift. And yet the math rewrote itself instantly.

At a hundred a set, Paul didn’t have four barrels anymore.

He had three.

Three sets he could lose before he was done — before he couldn’t even play cheap until payday. And suddenly the clock mattered too. Plenty of time for three more sets. Enough time to lose everything.

Paul nodded.

The next set started fine. He broke well. Took a rack. But between shots, his attention drifted — not to the balls, but to the edges of the situation. The money. The clock. The quiet way Chuck stood there like none of it applied to him.

Paul noticed himself calculating while he was down on the shot.

Chuck didn’t change.

Same pace. Same posture. Same refusal to acknowledge the stakes he’d just raised. When Paul missed, Chuck was already committed, already moving.

Paul lost the set.

Now he had two barrels.

They didn’t talk about it. They didn’t need to.

The next rack, Paul felt the table narrow. Not the pockets — the options. The method he’d practiced all summer was still there, but it felt exposed now, like it needed protection it wasn’t designed to ask for.

He checked a shot he hadn’t checked in months.

That was enough.

Chuck took the set.

Paul had one barrel left.

They racked again.

Paul knew, before the break, that he was playing a different game now. Not pool exactly. Something layered on top of it — time, money, consequence — all pressing inward without touching the balls themselves.

When it ended, Chuck gathered the bills quietly and slipped them back into his pocket.

“You’re good,” Chuck said. “You just ran out of room.”

Paul didn’t answer.

Chuck paused at the door.

“We’ll play again,” he said, like it was already scheduled.

Paul watched him go.

He knew, without needing to see it, that next time the number would change again — not because Chuck needed to win, but because Chuck needed the game to keep tightening. Chuck would raise the bet without blinking, the way people do when they’re not testing the money, but the person across from them.

(Exit)

The walk home stripped the noise away.

What stayed wasn’t the money. It was the certainty. Chuck wasn’t done. And the next raise wouldn’t be about fifty or a hundred — it would be about whether Paul could keep the table whole while everything around it kept shrinking.

Paul knew where that question had first found him.

And he knew it would be waiting.
