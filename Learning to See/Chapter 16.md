Chapter 16: The Glass House Shatters

The room looked clean in a way Paul didn’t register until later.

New lights. New rails. Simonis stretched tight and fast across every table. Nothing had soaked into it yet. No dead spots. No drag. The balls gleamed like they were waiting.

Paul noticed all of it.

He didn’t think any of it would matter.

The format did. Short races. No room to feel anything out. Lose twice and you were done. There would be no long sets, no time to learn the way cloth talked back.

The first rack went wrong without going badly.

The cue ball ran farther than he expected. Spin stayed alive longer. The object ball held its line instead of checking. Nothing dramatic. Nothing broken.

Just off.

Paul adjusted.

The second rack punished that adjustment.

A window he trusted closed early. A breakout glanced instead of biting. The cue ball arrived half a diamond too far and kept going.

He crossed the line once and felt it immediately. Dicey. The recovery shot demanded perfect speed.

He missed it by inches.

Not a choke.
A consequence.

He lost the set without ever feeling outplayed.

In the loser’s bracket, it got worse.

Different table. Same cloth. Same problem.

Paul stayed down. He didn’t rush. He planned early. He fixed what he could when he saw it. Everything Marek had taught him was still there, still operating.

It didn’t help.

The balls went places he hadn’t planned for and couldn’t predict fast enough. Not because he was nervous. Not because he was guessing.

Because he didn’t understand what was happening.

He knew it was the cloth.

That wasn’t the same as knowing anything useful.

Before he could adapt, the match was over.

Two and out.

Paul sat there longer than he should have, cue across his knees, watching another player rack like the table hadn’t just betrayed him.

The room didn’t care.

He replayed the racks and found no obvious mistakes. No panic. No hero shots. No shortcuts. Just a system that had depended on conditions he’d never named.

Simonis stripped those conditions away.

What was left still worked.

Just not enough.

Paul stood and packed up slowly, like the order of the motions might matter. It didn’t.

As he walked out, the image from the library rose up again without warning.

A beautiful glass house.

Not cracked.

Shattered.

Every clean line still visible. Every angle still perfect. Nothing missing except the thing that had held it together.

Outside, the air felt ordinary. The day moved on without him.

Paul stopped on the sidewalk and realized something that hollowed him out.

He didn’t know what to practice.

Not because he was tired.

Not because he was discouraged.

But because he no longer knew what the game was asking of him.

He stood there for a long time, cue in his hand, with nowhere to put it.

And for the first time since he’d picked one up, he wondered if everything he thought he understood had been holding him back.
