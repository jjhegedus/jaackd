Chapter 24: Acceleration and Deceleration

Paul had always thought speed was the thing.

Soft. Medium. Firm. Power. Touch.

Everyone talked about speed as if it were a property of the stroke at impact — how fast the cue was moving when it met the ball. Faster meant more draw. Slower meant more control. It all sounded clean.

It wasn’t.

What Paul started to notice was that shots with the same speed didn’t behave the same way.

The cue ball didn’t just move differently.

It felt different.

Once he’d stopped thinking about straightness, he began noticing how the stroke arrived at speed — not just how much speed it had. The cue didn’t simply show up at a number. It got there by passing through a sequence of states.

Acceleration mattered.

Not as an instruction.

As a signature.

Good strokes didn’t leap to speed. They gathered it. Not uniformly, not mechanically, but in a way that belonged to the same rhythm as the picture he’d built. Acceleration wasn’t added.

It emerged.

That was why “smooth” players weren’t slow.

They were continuous.

From a physics standpoint, this explained far more than Paul expected.

The cue ball didn’t respond to speed alone. It responded to how force was applied over time and space. The cue flexed. The tip compressed. Friction engaged. Spin developed.

Two strokes could produce the same apparent speed at contact and still deliver different cue-ball states because the acceleration profile had been different.

That was the missing variable.

Acceleration wasn’t just temporal — how fast speed increased.
It was spatial — where in the stroke force was being developed relative to the cue ball.

That was why some players could line up high and still draw the ball.
Why others could apply heavy English without apparent effort.
Why correcting their mechanics often made them worse.

They weren’t doing anything magical.

They were shaping the cue ball’s arrival — its velocity and rotation — without thinking about the cue at all.

Acceleration was doing the work.

Deceleration entered the picture next, and this was where Paul had been mistaken before.

Deceleration wasn’t always bad.

What mattered was why it was happening.

Some players accelerated early, reached a peak, and then let the cue coast through contact. Others continued accelerating right up to and through impact.

Both could work.

Both did work.

The difference wasn’t the shape of the curve.

It was whether deceleration was resolved or corrective.

Resolved deceleration belonged to a committed plan. The system knew where it was going. The cue ball arrived in the intended state.

Corrective deceleration came from doubt.

That kind of deceleration wasn’t planned. It wasn’t chosen. It showed up as restraint — a subtle braking layered into motion that had already been decided.

Paul recognized it instantly.

That was the stroke that felt like it hesitated without stopping.
The one that felt supervised.
The one that sounded thin at contact.

Very careful.

That phrase again.

Careful strokes decelerated not because the shot required it, but because the player was trying to protect against something they no longer trusted.

This is where vision came back into the picture.

Paul realized that acceleration wasn’t just physical.

It was diagnostic.

When the picture was wide — when the pockets held the space and the table felt stable — acceleration resolved naturally. The stroke expressed the plan without interference.

When the picture collapsed — when foveal vision took over and the world shrank — acceleration distorted automatically.

Not by choice.

By reflex.

The moment Paul doubted what he was seeing, his body tried to save the shot. It softened the delivery. It flattened the acceleration. It introduced micro-braking.

The cue ball didn’t do what he expected — not because he’d hit it wrong, but because he’d arrived differently.

Same speed.

Different state.

That explained something he’d never been able to articulate before.

Why pressure ruined “easy” shots more than hard ones.
Why misses under pressure were often under-hit.
Why trying to be smooth sometimes made things worse.

Acceleration wasn’t something you added to fix a shot.

It was something that collapsed when perception fractured.

Paul understood now why acceleration was so rarely taught well.

You couldn’t see it in a mirror.
You couldn’t freeze-frame it.
You couldn’t correct it directly.

Acceleration lived in time and state.

Trying to manage it explicitly only created more interference.

Acceleration without rhythm was rushing.
Acceleration without lock-in was panic.
Acceleration without trust was violence.

But acceleration emerging from a coherent perceptual state?

That was the stroke everyone was chasing without knowing it.

Paul stopped trying to “accelerate through” the ball.

He stopped trying to avoid deceleration.

He paid attention to whether the system stayed intact from picture to delivery.

When it did, acceleration took care of itself.

The cue ball arrived alive — spinning, moving, unfolding the shot the way it had already been imagined.

When it didn’t, no amount of effort helped.

That was the uncomfortable truth.

Acceleration wasn’t a technique.

It was the physical expression of belief.

And belief, Paul was learning, didn’t live in the mind.

It lived in whether the world stayed stable long enough for the body to finish what it had already started.
