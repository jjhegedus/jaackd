Chapter 18: Other Rooms

The university room stayed exactly the same.

That was the problem.

Same tables. Same cloth. Same lights. Same rhythm. Paul could walk in, rack up, and feel settled before the first ball dropped. The place didn’t surprise him anymore.

After regionals, surprise was what he needed.

So when someone mentioned a weekly tournament across town, Paul said yes without thinking it through.

He needed a ride.

Eli drove most nights. Iris came along sometimes. A couple of others squeezed in, cues knocking together in the back seat. Paul didn’t rehearse shots on the way. He watched the streets change and tried to notice how little he knew about where they were going.

The weekly was stronger than the university room.

Not vicious. Not showy.

Just deeper.

Peru Paul. Danny Martin. Tony Blankenship. Names Paul had heard, now attached to people who didn’t rush and didn’t explain themselves. They didn’t play tight. They didn’t look careful. They missed sometimes — and didn’t react when they did.

Paul played well.

He always did now.

He stayed inside his patterns. Managed the table. Avoided risk when he could. When he lost, it was close and quiet.

What bothered him was how the better players lost.

They didn’t shrink.
They didn’t narrow.
They didn’t get smaller when the room got harder.

They opened.

In bigger tournaments, the gap widened.

Paul didn’t play all of them, but he saw enough to know. Steve Oak leaning into a shot like the table owed him something. Big Arm John hitting balls at speeds Paul avoided. Brian Groce recovering from positions Paul would have spent two shots trying not to reach. Mark Jarvis and George Breedlove moving through racks without visible caution.

They weren’t reckless.

But they weren’t careful either.

Paul noticed how rarely they seemed to protect themselves. They didn’t manage outcomes the way he did. They didn’t appear to be constantly preventing something bad from happening.

They allowed things.

The realization didn’t arrive cleanly. It came in pieces, between matches, watching from a chair he hadn’t chosen. Paul felt it first as discomfort, not insight.

He was very careful.

Careful with speed.
Careful with patterns.
Careful not to cross the line.

Careful not to lose.

And somehow, that care made him smaller in rooms where the best players seemed to expand.

On the rides home, Paul replayed racks that hadn’t gone wrong — they’d just gone tight. He thought about how often he’d chosen the safe option even when the aggressive one was there.

He wasn’t afraid.

That wasn’t it.

He just didn’t trust what would happen if he stopped being careful.

The sentence from the hall came back again, unchanged.

You can never be too careful.

For the first time, Paul felt it shift slightly — not into its opposite, not into a lesson — just into something that no longer sat flat.

He kept going to other rooms.
Kept playing stronger fields.
Kept improving the way he always had.

But now, each time he watched the best players move through a rack without visible restraint, the same quiet question followed him home:

What if careful wasn’t discipline?

What if it was a ceiling?

He didn’t know the answer.

He only knew that the rooms were asking him something new.

And he didn’t yet know how to respond.
