Chapter 13: The Wall Works Both Ways

The university room ran on a schedule Paul knew by muscle memory. Open at four. Close at eleven. Ten on Sundays. No exceptions.

Paul was there when the lights came on and still there when they went off. Not because he had nowhere else to be — because this was where the day made sense.

He was mid-rack when Marek leaned in from the next table.

“That guy under your picture,” Marek said quietly.

Paul glanced up.

He didn’t need to ask who.

Billy stood with his back to the wall, directly beneath the photograph. It was staged and unmistakable — Paul behind the table with the trophy in one hand and his cue in the other, smile caught halfway between relief and disbelief. The lighting was clean. The angle deliberate. This wasn’t a moment someone had found. It had been arranged.

Billy wasn’t studying the room. He wasn’t studying Paul. He stood out the way people do when they don’t blend and don’t intend to.

“Road man,” Marek said. Not impressed. Not worried. Just stating weather. “He’s here to play you. Get ready.”

Word moved sideways.

Chairs shifted. Nearby games finished and didn’t rerack. Eli appeared at the rail without saying anything. Iris paused two tables over and stayed paused. The room didn’t quiet — it focused.

Billy waited until Paul finished the set he was already in.

He didn’t compliment. Didn’t introduce himself. He nodded once toward the table.

Paul nodded back.

They played.

Not cheap. Not reckless. Enough to matter.

Paul lost the first set cleanly. A couple of balls caught the point instead of falling. Nothing dramatic. The second went worse. He felt his attention narrow as the eyes around the table multiplied.

He didn’t talk.

Didn’t explain.

Didn’t look anywhere but the table.

By the third set, he slowed just enough to let the noise exist without answering it. The table arrived in fragments at first — cue ball, object ball, pocket — then stitched itself back together.

Paul took the third.

The fourth stayed tight the whole way. Billy bore down the way people do when they’ve lived inside pressure longer than applause. Paul missed late and paid for it.

They were in the sixth set when the announcement came.

“Last rack.”

Not a warning. Not a suggestion. Just fact.

The room closed at eleven whether you were ahead, behind, or lining up the last ball.

Paul and Billy finished the rack. Billy won it.

They stood there for a moment, chalk still in hand, the table unfinished by intention rather than outcome.

Paul checked the clock.

Eleven.

“No time for another set,” Paul said.

Billy nodded. “Fair.”

They packed up together. No rush. No disappointment. Just acknowledgment.

Someone Paul knew caught his sleeve as he turned toward the door.

“Listen,” he said quietly. “Road men don’t just play.”

Paul frowned. “What do you mean?”

“I mean robbed,” the guy said. “Followed. I mean you don’t go wandering off at eleven with someone you don’t know just because he can run balls.”

Paul glanced at Billy, already a few steps ahead.

The warning landed heavier than he expected.

Part of him bristled. Part of him felt something uglier — an old reflex he hated recognizing. His dad’s stories about Detroit. The prejudice that had always embarrassed Paul even when he was too young to name it.

That discomfort nudged him out the door anyway.

Billy’s car sat under a broken light.

As Paul got in, he was aware — uncomfortably — of how quiet the street had gotten.

They drove a few blocks in silence.

“You’re getting a reputation,” Billy said. Not accusing. Just factual.

Paul swallowed. “For what?”

“For being worth the drive,” Billy said. “I wasn’t passing through. I heard about the kid from Purdue.”

Paul watched the streetlights streak past the windshield.

The hall by the tracks was dark.

Paper taped to the door. Closed — Remodeling.

Billy exhaled through his nose. “Figures.”

Paul scanned the block, irritated now, the night still buzzing. Then he saw it.

POOL
OVERTIME

“That sign says pool,” Paul said.

Billy shrugged. “Worth a look.”

As they crossed the street, a man stepped out of the door.

Hat low. Unhurried. Paul recognized him the way you recognize a rhythm before a face.

The man glanced at them as they passed.

“You sure you want to go in there?” he asked casually, already moving on.

Paul didn’t answer.

They went in.

The room was narrow and loud, bass pressing against the walls. Paul stepped up to the bar, still scanning for felt and rails.

The bartender spoke without turning around.

“You’re in the wrong place.”

Paul felt it before he saw it — the shift behind him. Three men at the end of the bar had gone still. One turned just enough to make eye contact. Another set his drink down carefully.

They looked ready.

Billy nodded immediately. “Alright.”

Paul stepped forward. “What the hell is that supposed to—”

Billy’s hand closed around Paul’s arm.

“Not this one,” he said quietly.

The bartender never turned.

Outside, the door shut behind them with a dull weight.

Paul spun back toward it. “You’re just going to let that—”

Billy moved him farther into the lot, away from the light.

“This is a conversation for another place,” Billy said.

Paul shook his arm free. “Why?”

Billy glanced back.

“Because if we stand here long enough,” he said, “those guys are going to decide it’s time to come out and have some fun.”

The door stayed closed.

That didn’t make it better.

They drove back toward campus without talking much.

Garcia’s was open.

They slid into a booth. Pizza arrived. Beer too. The noise felt safer than it had any right to.

Billy took a sip and set the bottle down.

“You play honest,” he said. “That’s why people talk.”

Paul stared at the table.

He understood then that the warning hadn’t been about Billy.

It had been about rooms. About stories. About what you carry with you without choosing.

The picture on the wall wasn’t recognition.

It was exposure.

And once it went up, the world answered.
