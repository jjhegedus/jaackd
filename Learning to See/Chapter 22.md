Chapter 22: Breath and Rhythm

Paul had always heard people talk about breathing.

Instructors talked about it. Commentators talked about it. Players talked about it the way they talked about chalk or stance—something you were supposed to manage once things got serious.

None of it had ever felt right to him.

It always came with instructions. Inhale here. Exhale there. Hold it. Let it out. As if there were a single correct place for breath to be when the cue went forward.

Paul didn’t believe that.

What he started noticing instead wasn’t where the breath was, but whether it was still moving.

When the table felt large—when the pockets held the space and the balls felt like fixed objects instead of fragile targets—his breathing was simply happening. Unforced. Unremarkable. Not something he noticed until afterward.

When the table shrank, his breath didn’t go wrong.

It got interrupted.

Sometimes it shortened. Sometimes it stalled. Sometimes it hit a hard edge it hadn’t hit a moment earlier. The commonality wasn’t pattern—it was discontinuity.

That was the same thing he’d been noticing with pauses.

Traditional pauses were everywhere. Players froze over the ball because someone had told them to. They held still because stillness was supposed to mean control. They waited for certainty to arrive.

Paul started to suspect that most pauses weren’t about readiness at all.

They were about reassurance.

He watched a player at the next table lock up over a straight-in shot. Everything stopped—body, breath, awareness. The pause felt brittle. The shot missed.

Another player took nearly as long over a tougher shot, but nothing actually stopped. Movement slowed, narrowed, softened—but breath continued. Rhythm stayed intact. The stroke arrived without announcement.

That shot went in.

Paul realized then that “pause” was the wrong word for what worked.

What worked wasn’t stopping.

It was not breaking continuity.

From a physics standpoint, the difference mattered.

The body wasn’t a rigid frame waiting for action. It was a dynamic system—lungs, diaphragm, spine, balance—all subtly in motion whether you acknowledged it or not. Breath wasn’t noise layered on top of precision; it was part of the system’s baseline motion.

Interrupting it changed the state.

That didn’t mean breath needed to be controlled. It meant it needed to be left alone.

The same was true of pauses.

A pause that emerged naturally—because the system had assembled and wasn’t in a hurry—felt open. Spacious. The table stayed coherent. The fiducials stayed present.

A pause that was imposed—because someone felt unsure—did something else entirely. It invited evaluation back in. It reopened questions that had already been answered. It fractured the state the shot depended on.

Paul thought about Efren Reyes.

Everyone talked about Efren’s pause. They pointed to it like proof that pausing was essential, like it was the thing you copied if you wanted to be great.

But Paul had watched Efren closely.

Efren didn’t pause and then shoot.

He paused, yes—but only long enough to rebuild rhythm.

After the pause, there was always the same sequence. One practice stroke. Not two. Not three. One. And then the final stroke arrived exactly where that practice stroke had been headed.

The pause wasn’t an ending.

It was a reset.

Efren never froze and then fired from stillness. He never tried to launch a stroke from a dead system. The pause cleared noise, and the single practice stroke reestablished continuity. Breath, motion, perception—everything came back online the same way every time.

Then the shot happened.

Paul realized that what people copied wasn’t what mattered.

They copied the pause.

Efren was preserving the rhythm.

Pressure made this distinction impossible to ignore.

Under pressure, pauses multiplied. Players didn’t pause because the shot needed it. They paused because they did. Breath stopped. Awareness narrowed. The self got loud.

Very careful.

Paul smiled faintly at that again.

Careful players paused more than anyone.

Not because pausing was good—but because they didn’t trust what would happen if they didn’t.

That explained why great players often looked relaxed instead of precise. Why they appeared unhurried without being slow. Why their strokes arrived without ceremony.

They weren’t pausing less.

They were interrupting less.

Paul didn’t try to fix his breathing.

He didn’t remove pauses from his routine either.

He stopped adding them.

He let rhythm do what it was already doing. He noticed when continuity was intact—and when it wasn’t. Sometimes that meant a visible pause. Sometimes it didn’t.

There was no rule.

That was the point.

The game wasn’t asking for a breath at a certain time.
It wasn’t asking for stillness in a certain place.

It was asking for a single, continuous state to carry perception into action without being torn apart by doubt.

Most traditional pauses didn’t help with that.

They masked its absence.

Paul didn’t feel enlightened by this.

He felt relieved.

Because for the first time, he didn’t feel like there was a missing trick he hadn’t been taught.

Just a habit of interruption he was finally learning to recognize.
