Chapter 14: Diagrams

It had been weeks since Paul had last seen the man in the chair.

Long enough that the details had thinned out. The hat. The corner. The way the words had landed and stayed. Long enough that the sentence no longer startled him when it came back.

A beautiful glass house.

It followed him without urgency. Not like a warning. More like a label he didn’t yet know where to stick.

After Billy, it came back stronger.

Not because Billy had said anything like it — he hadn’t — but because the night had exposed the same feeling in a different way. The sense that something Paul relied on assumed the world would meet him halfway. That rooms would be neutral. That skill would be sufficient.

That assumption had held. Until it didn’t.

When things didn’t sit right, Paul defaulted to structure.

He pulled a pad of graph paper from the bottom of his desk drawer and drew the table. Then drew it again more carefully. Rails. Pockets. Distances. He didn’t expect drawing to make him better. He needed a place to put what his head kept circling.

He started with shots he knew.

Lines from cue ball to object ball. Object ball to pocket. Cue ball paths after contact. The old rules came back easily. Tangent line. Thirty degrees. Ninety degrees. He drew them cleanly.

They held—sometimes.

Then he drew what actually happened.

The lines drifted. Paths bent. The cue ball went where the rule said it shouldn’t have.

He erased and redrew. Same problem.

He set the shots up on the bar table at home and watched carefully. Came back and adjusted the diagrams. Still off.

So he stopped pretending the differences were noise and started writing them down.

Soft.
Medium.
Firm.

Rolling.
Stun.
Drag.

Minimal draw.
Medium draw.
Max draw.

He didn’t know why the transitions happened the way they did. He didn’t need to yet. What mattered was that they were consistent. If he hit this way, that happened. If he added a hair of speed, something else happened. If he crossed the line, the margin shrank exactly the way Marek had warned him it would.

The diagrams filled up.

He practiced to match them.

Not once or twice — for weeks.

He set shots up and hit them the same way over and over until he could tell what the cue ball would do before it did it. He learned where the tangent line held and where it quietly failed. He learned how a little top killed throw and how a little draw magnified it. He learned how much speed erased forgiveness and how much created it.

He still didn’t know why any of it worked.

But he knew how.

And that was enough to keep going.

In the room, his game felt calmer again. More predictable. He could feel the windows opening and closing before he got to them. He could choose whether to live inside them.

Chuck stopped finding easy places to lean.

Billy stayed gone.

The picture stayed on the wall.

And still, the sentence wouldn’t leave him alone.

A beautiful glass house.

Because even as Paul’s predictions got better, something else stayed true: everything he knew depended on conditions staying within a narrow range. Speed. Cloth. Light. Attention. Rooms.

When the conditions shifted, even slightly, the diagrams stopped being maps and started being guesses.

He could feel the missing variables now.

Not as panic. Not as confusion.

As absence.

He packed the graph paper away carefully, like it was something delicate.

He didn’t feel exposed.

He felt unfinished.

And the glass house — clean, precise, elegant — continued to glisten in his mind.

Intact.

For now.
